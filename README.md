## Installation

### Build Locally (Recommended for development)

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mattiaginoble/tarkhub.git
   cd tarkhub
   ```

2. **Build and start with Docker Compose:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   This will build the multi-stage Docker image as described in `Dockerfile`:

   - Frontend built with Node and Vite
   - Backend built with .NET (C#)
   - Nginx serves frontend and proxies to backend

3. **Access the web UI:**
   - Open your browser at [https://localhost:6969/mod](https://localhost:6969/mod)

### Use Prebuilt Image from ghcr.io

You can pull the latest image from GitHub Container Registry and use it directly in your `docker-compose.yml`.

```yaml
services:
  tarkhub:
    image: ghcr.io/mattiaginoble/tarkhub:latest
    container_name: tarkhub
    ports:
      - 6969:6969
    environment:
      - FORGE_API_KEY=${FORGE_API_KEY}
      - SPT_VERSION=${SPT_VERSION}
      - FIKA_VERSION=${FIKA_VERSION}
    volumes:
      - server:/app/spt-server
      - user:/app/user
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  server: null
  user: null
```

**To pull and run:**

```bash
docker compose up
```

You can also specify a version/tag published on [ghcr.io](https://github.com/users/mattiaginoble/packages/container/package/tarkhub).

- Create your modlist, add mods, export or import lists
- Manage SPT and Fika versions, update mods, and more!

---

## Docker

- **Multi-stage build:** See `Dockerfile` for details.

  - Stage 1: Builds the frontend (React/TypeScript)
  - Stage 2: Builds the backend (.NET/C#)
  - Stage 3: Combines everything, serves with Nginx and runs the backend

- **Nginx:** Configured via `nginx.conf`, serves the SPA and proxies API requests to backend.

- **Volumes:**

  - `/app/spt-server`: Persistent storage for SPT server files
  - `/app/user`: Persistent storage for user data and configs

- **Environment variables:**
  - `FORGE_API_KEY`: API key for Forge
  - `SPT_VERSION`, `FIKA_VERSION`: Used for mod compatibility/versioning
